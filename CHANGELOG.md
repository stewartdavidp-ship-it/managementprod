# Command Center — Changelog

## [8.45.0] — 2026-02-10

### Added
- **ProductBriefGenerator** — Auto-generates PRODUCT_BRIEF.md from scope data, work items, deploys, streams, and lifecycle metadata. PM-language product description for cross-stream context sharing.
- **PRODUCT_BRIEF.md in Claude Prep packages** — Auto-generated and included in every session package. Design/Research sessions always include it; other session types prefer-include it.
- **ProductBriefModal** — Lightweight viewer (📄 button on app rows in Projects view) with rendered markdown and copy-to-clipboard
- **Product decisions formatting** — Scoping category answers translated to human-readable decisions (e.g. dataPersistence: firebase → "Saves to cloud, syncs across devices")
- **Feature inventory by status** — Shipped, In Progress, Planned, Ideas sections from work items with fallback to scope v1Features
- **Token estimation** — PRODUCT_BRIEF.md added to Environment Optimization doc listing (~3,000 tokens)

### Changed
- All 8 SESSION_TYPES context strategies updated to include PRODUCT_BRIEF.md (alwaysInclude for design/research, preferInclude for others)
- classifyFileAction treats PRODUCT_BRIEF.md as 'skip' (auto-generated, not pushed to repo)
- alreadyFetched set includes PRODUCT_BRIEF.md to avoid duplicate scanning

## [8.44.0] — 2026-02-10

### Added
- **DependencyAlertService** — Firebase service for dependency alert lifecycle (pending → updated/no_impact) with full CRUD, session/stream filtering, and getNextId
- **triggerAlerts()** — Orchestrated auto-remediation: detects dependencies on changed interface → creates work items in dependent streams → creates alert records → marks dependencies as 'changed' → logs to activity feed
- **Interface change detection in Post-Session Review** — Step 1 shows checklist of provided interfaces with dependents; user checks what changed, describes the change, and triggers alerts
- **Prompt chaining in SessionBriefGenerator** — dependency_update work items inject "Dependency Changes — Context from Source Session" section into session briefs with change description, affected interfaces, and source session notes
- **Pending alerts on stream cards** — Amber badge showing pending dependency updates count with change details
- **Pending Alerts summary stat** — WorkStreamsView summary row shows alert count when > 0
- **handleResolveAlert()** — Resolve alerts as 'updated' (verifies dependency) or 'no_impact' (dismisses)
- **globalDependencyAlerts** state — App component state with Firebase listener for `command-center/{uid}/dependencyAlerts`

### Changed
- PostSessionReviewModal receives streams, interfaces, dependencies, dependencyAlerts props
- SessionLogView passes stream/dependency props to PostSessionReviewModal
- WorkStreamsView accepts and uses globalDependencyAlerts prop
- Summary stats grid dynamically shows 5 columns when alerts pending
