## [8.15.3] — 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **Doc files not clearing after push** — batch deploy and Deploy All modal now remove successfully pushed docs from staged files via `setStagedFiles` filter, preventing double-push loop
- **Wrong doc target path for standalone repos** — zip-derived paths like `command-center/CONTEXT.md` were used instead of root `CONTEXT.md`; default `docTargetPath` now uses `fileName` not zip `targetPath`

## [8.15.2] — 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **Seed drift** — Quotle icon (📖→💬), quotle-info name (Quotle.info→Quotle-info), CC appType (internal→public) in manifest, seeds, and app definitions
- **Copy buttons** — added 📋 Copy button inside both doc validation and config drift prompt text blocks

## [8.15.1] — 2026-02-09

### Added
- **`CC_SEED_MANIFEST`** — machine-readable JSON block in index.html capturing identity fields for all seed projects and apps, delimited by comment markers for easy parsing
- **`detectConfigDrift()`** — compares manifest from staged HTML against running config; checks gs-app-id, project names/presence, app identity fields; classifies as error/warn/info
- **Config ↔ Code Drift banner** — color-coded banner (red/orange/blue) in staged files area when deploying CC; shows all drifts with Copy Fix Prompt button and expandable Claude prompt

## [8.15.0] — 2026-02-09

### Changed
- **App identity rename: management → command-center** — full rename across all code, seeds, detection, mappings, and UI defaults
- **Page title** — "Command Center" (was "Game Shelf Command Center")
- **gs-app-id meta tag** — `command-center` (was `management`)
- **DEFAULT_APP_DEFINITIONS** — key and id changed to `command-center`
- **Hardcoded fallback detection** — legacy signature updated
- **Default deploy target** — `command-center` (was `management`)
- **Repo-to-app-id mappings** — Smart Deploy + Claude Prep updated
- **Internal tools list** — Projects view updated
- **Console startup log** — now shows v8.15.0

### Added
- **localStorage migration** — `mergeWithDefaults()` auto-renames `management` → `command-center` in stored config

## [8.14.2] — 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **Batch deploy controls** — now correctly split deploy files from push-doc files; shows "Deploy 1 file + Push 6 docs" instead of treating all files as deploy targets
- **Doc files inherit primaryApp** — post-extraction assigns detected app from index.html to all doc files in the same zip package
- **Batch action handler** — refactored into single `executeBatchAction()` that deploys files to Pages AND pushes docs to source repo in one click

## [8.14.1] — 2026-02-09

### Added
- **`validateDocPackage()`** — checks staged files for missing required docs and version alignment between deploy files and doc headers
- **Doc validation banner** — amber warning banner in staged files area showing missing docs, version mismatches, and expandable Claude fix prompt
- **Copy Fix Prompt** — one-click button copies a pre-written prompt for Claude with specific files and versions to fix
- **Per-file doc indicators** — green ✓ or amber ⚠️ inline on each doc file card showing version alignment status

## [8.14.0] — 2026-02-09

### Added
- **Unified deploy + push docs** — files dropped on dashboard auto-classified as deploy (`.html/.js/.json`) or push-doc (`.md/.txt`); both handled in single "Deploy All" flow
- **`classifyFileAction()`** — helper that routes files by name/extension; known doc files → `push-doc`, `SESSION_BRIEF.md` → `skip`, deploy files → `deploy`
- **Staged file visual distinction** — doc files show cyan "📄 Push to repo:" label; deploy files show standard "Deploy as:"
- **DeployAllModal** — now shows two sections: "🚀 Deploy to GitHub Pages" and "📄 Push docs to repo" with separate counts and adaptive button text
- **Batch doc push** — groups docs by app, checks SHA for existing files, commits via GitHub API
- **File input accepts .md/.txt** — upload and drop zone now accept doc files

## [8.13.2.0] — 2026-02-09

### Changed
- **Config as source of truth** — `mergeWithDefaults()` no longer force-merges `DEFAULT_APP_DEFINITIONS` into stored apps on every load; seed data used only for first-time initialization
- **Schema migration** — `mergeWithDefaults()` now only ensures structural fields exist (repos, versions, createdAt, detectionPatterns) without overwriting user values

### Removed
- **`DEFAULT_APP_DEFINITIONS` runtime fallbacks** — 8 references across deploy, Smart Deploy, version checking, and Projects views replaced with `config.apps[appId]`
- **`subPath` fallback pattern** — `DEFAULT_APP_DEFINITIONS[appId]?.subPath` fallback removed from all 8 locations; simplified to `app.subPath || ''`
- **`SEED_PROJECTS` force-merge** — existing stored projects are no longer merged with seed definitions on every load

## [8.13.1.7] — 2026-02-09

### Changed
- **Command Center project independence** — `management` app seed now defaults to `project: 'command-center'` (was `'gameshelf'`), icon updated to 🏗️, `repoPatterns` updated to `command-center` / `command-center-test`
- **SEED_PROJECTS** — added `command-center` project definition (🏗️, cyan), re-ordered existing projects

## [8.13.1.6] — 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **Version scanner false positives** — extracted `SEED_VERSION` constant for `generateInitialHTML()` and `generateAdminHTML()` scaffolding; `0.1.0` no longer appears as literal meta/footer versions in CC source
- **shouldSkip() lookback range** — increased from 500 to 1000 chars to catch `generate*()` function declarations further from their template content
- **Placeholder version patterns** — `X.X.X` / `X.Y.Z` format auto-skipped as obvious non-versions

## [8.13.1.5] — 2026-02-07

### Added
- **Project emoji picker** — categorized emoji grid in ProjectEditModal, same UX as app modal

## [8.13.1.4] — 2026-02-07

### Added
- **Extra docs scanning** in Claude Prep — scans repo root for additional .md/.txt files beyond the standard set and includes them in the package

## [8.13.1.3] — 2026-02-07

### Fixed
- Push Docs progress — clear visual states: green push button → amber pulsing during push → green completion banner → red error banner with retry

## [8.13.1.2] — 2026-02-07

### Fixed
- Push Docs UI flow — eliminated toggle confusion. Three-step progression: button → drop zone → staged files + push. Clear button replaced by Cancel link.

## [8.13.1.1] — 2026-02-07

### Added
- **Zip support for Push Docs** — drop a .zip package and all .md/.txt files are extracted automatically. Deduplicates by filename.

## [8.13.1.0] — 2026-02-07

### Added
- **Push Docs to Repo** — new feature in Claude Prep modal. Drop .md/.txt files, CC checks repo for existing SHAs, pushes via GitHub API with create/update support.

## [8.13.0.9] — 2026-02-07

### Fixed
- **App detection** — new dynamic pattern matching tier using configurable detection patterns from app config. Scores all apps by specificity (match count + pattern length) to pick best match. Fixes "Rungs Builder" detected as "Rungs" issue.
- Exposed `window.__CC_APPS` for detection function access outside React

## [8.13.0.8] — 2026-02-07

### Fixed
- Auto-generated detection patterns — replaced competing useEffect hooks with single `handleNameChange()` function to eliminate race condition

## [8.13.0.7] — 2026-02-07

### Added
- **Emoji picker** on AppEditModal — categorized grid with Tools, Games, Objects, Symbols, Combo sections
- **Auto-generated detection patterns** — title, kebab-case, camelCase, UPPER_CASE patterns generated as user types app name

## [8.13.0.6] — 2026-02-07

- Preview path display when repo + subPath set
- Toggle to "Manual entry" mode for advanced pattern editing

## [8.13.0.4] — 2026-02-07

### Added
- **Sub Path field** in AppEditModal — monospace input for specifying app subdirectory within shared repos

## [8.13.0] — 2025-02-07

### Added
- **Claude Prep feature** — 🤖 button on each app row in ProjectsTab to prepare context packages for Claude sessions
- **ClaudePrepModal component** — Progress modal that fetches source + docs from repo, generates session brief, builds downloadable zip
- **SESSION_BRIEF.md generation** — Auto-generated from CC data: versions, recent deploys, open issues, app config
- **Doc bootstrapping** — When docs don't exist in repo, generates skeleton CONTEXT.md, PROJECT_PLAN.md, CHANGELOG.md, RELEASE_NOTES.txt templates
- **Doc detection logic** — Standalone repos check root, consolidated repos check `{subPath}/docs/` then `{subPath}/` then root
- **CLAUDE_PREP_DOCS constant** — Standard doc filenames for the package convention
- Helper functions: `generateSessionBrief()`, `generateSkeletonContext()`, `generateSkeletonPlan()`, `generateSkeletonChangelog()`, `getDocsPath()`
