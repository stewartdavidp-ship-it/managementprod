All notable changes to Command Center are documented in this file.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
Versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

---

## [8.36.5] — 2026-02-10

### Added
- **StorageManager** — intelligent localStorage cleanup system with auto-pruning on QuotaExceededError
- **Storage diagnostics panel** in Settings — visual usage bar, per-key breakdown, smart/aggressive cleanup buttons
- **`safeSet()` wrapper** — DeployService, SessionLogService, RollbackService now auto-cleanup when quota is exceeded

### Fixed
- **Doc push button lockout** — deploy button stays disabled with "Pushing docs..." spinner through entire batch action (deploy + doc push)

---

## [8.36.3] — 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- **Version downgrade protection** — version validation now applies to ALL deploy intents (quick-deploy, targeted-update), not just full packages
- **Downgrade vs same-version distinction** — deploying an older version shows error severity; same version shows warning
- **Smart deploy target selection** — dropdown intelligently defaults based on app repo config (two-repo → TEST, prod-only → PROD)
- **Target dropdown filtering** — only shows valid environments for selected app
- **Post-deploy reset** — resets to app's smart default instead of always TEST
- **Version extraction for renamed files** — handles `targetPath === 'index.html'` and single-file fallback

---

## [8.36.0] — 2026-02-10

### Added
- **Unified Package Validation Engine** — `validatePackage()` consolidates 4 separate validation mechanisms into a single selection-driven system with intent detection
- **`getValidationIntent()`** — classifies uploads as `quick-deploy`, `targeted-update`, `deploy-package`, `full-package`, or `docs-only` based on selected file composition
- **Inline validation panel** — three-tier visual display (grey info / amber warning / red error) inside deploy controls, replaces all modal/alert-based validation
- **Version bump in CC** — code-only deploys get a bump button in the validation panel; updates all version strings in index.html and sw.js CACHE_VERSION in one click
- **Claude fix prompt generation** — `generateClaudeFixPrompt()` builds contextual prompt with grouped sections for version issues, PWA completeness, missing docs, and doc version alignment
- **Deploy button state machine** — button disabled on errors (with override checkbox), amber on warnings, normal on clean/info
- **Top-level `bumpVersion()` utility** — extracted from VersionBumpModal to module scope for use by validation engine

### Removed
- **`validateDocPackage()`** and associated `useMemo` / amber banner UI
- **Post-extraction `showAlert()` calls** for version mismatch and PWA incompleteness
- **Deploy-time `showConfirm()` dialogs** for version issues and same-version deploys
- **`VersionWarningModal` trigger** in single-file deploy handler (component retained, trigger removed)
- **Per-file doc version alignment indicators** (green/amber on file cards)

### Changed
- `handleBatchDeploy` no longer checks version validation or version increment at deploy time — handled pre-deploy by validation panel
- `handleDeploy` no longer triggers VersionWarningModal — handled pre-deploy by validation panel
- Deploy controls IIFE now computes validation and passes result to both panel and deploy button

## [8.35.0] — 2026-02-10

### Changed
- **App Files view** — Dropdown now shows apps by name (not repo) with PROD/TEST labels; apps sharing repos (Game Shelf, Quotle, etc.) are individually selectable
- **SubPath-aware file browser** — Selecting an app shows only that app's files (e.g., Game Shelf shows `app/` contents, not repo root)
- **Expandable folders** — Directories show as 📁 with click-to-expand; files within folders are visible with full view/download/delete actions
- **Download Package** — Correctly scopes to app's subPath; zip paths are relative (no `app/` prefix in zip structure)
- **Version Audit** — Uses selected app's subPath to find the correct `index.html`
- **Zip naming** — Uses app ID (`gameshelf-latest`) instead of repo name

## [8.34.0] — 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- **Stale File Cleanup guardrails** — `.github/`, `package.json`, `firebase.json`, `.firebaserc`, and other CI/CD-critical files are now globally protected and never flagged as stale
- **`firebase-functions` package type** — `gameshelf-functions` repo now correctly recognized with `functions/`, `.github/`, and config files as expected (was defaulting to `pwa` type)
- **Critical file delete warning** — second confirmation dialog with explicit file names when selecting workflow, config, or build files for deletion

### Changed
- `getAppType()` now recognizes `firebase-functions` and `gameshelf-functions` repos
- `isBaseFile()` checks `GLOBALLY_PROTECTED_PATHS` before package-specific rules
- `deleteSelectedFiles()` adds extra confirmation for `.github/`, `deploy.yml`, `package.json`, `firebase.json`, `.firebaserc`

## [8.33.0] — 2026-02-10

### Added
- **GoDaddyService** — Full API wrapper for GoDaddy domain registrar: domain listing, DNS CRUD (list, add, delete-via-replace), GitHub Pages DNS auto-configuration. Auth via sso-key header. Handles GoDaddy's replace-all approach for record deletion.

- `globalWorkItems` prop threaded through App → ProjectsTab → ClaudePrepModal

---

## [8.24.0] — 2026-02-09

- **App Lifecycle metadata** — `app.lifecycle` object in ConfigManager: category (game/tool/dashboard/content/admin), currentMaturity, maturityTarget, problemStatement, targetAudience, userGoal, successMetric, stack, maturityCriteria
- **AppEditModal Lifecycle tab** — New ⚙️ General | 📊 Lifecycle tab navigation; lifecycle tab has category, maturity, problem/audience/goal/metric fields, visual maturity progress bar
- **Orchestrator Phase 0.2** — Foundation services for AI Development Orchestrator

### Changed
- `ConfigManager.mergeWithDefaults()` — ensures lifecycle fields exist on all stored apps (schema migration)
- `ConfigManager.addApp()` — includes lifecycle metadata in new app definitions
- `AppEditModal` — tabbed interface (general + lifecycle), save handler includes lifecycle data

### Architecture
- Four new service objects follow established Phase 0.1 pattern (standalone objects, Firebase RTDB or localStorage persistence)
- WorkItemService & SessionService use per-user Firebase paths (`command-center/{uid}/backlog`, `command-center/{uid}/sessions`)
- TokenRegistryService is pure client-side (no Firebase dependency)
- EngineRegistryService is static reference data with localStorage preference for default engine
- Lifecycle fields are additive — existing apps get empty defaults, no data loss

## [8.19.0] — 2026-02-09

### Added
- **Data Service Layer** — Six service objects extracted from App() and views: DeployService, SessionLogService, IssueService, ReleaseService, UserReportService, RollbackService
- **Orchestrator Phase 0.1** — Foundation for AI Development Orchestrator evolution

### Changed
- All deploy history persistence routed through `DeployService` (localStorage + Firebase dual-write)
- All session log persistence routed through `SessionLogService`
- All rollback snapshot persistence routed through `RollbackService`
- All issues CRUD in IssuesView routed through `IssueService` and `ReleaseService`
- Global issues listener in App() uses `IssueService.listen()`
- Issue-to-version linking uses `IssueService.linkToVersion()`
- Firebase startup overlay uses service `.overlay()` methods
- Force sync and push-all operations use service `.load()` methods

### Architecture
- Services follow `FirebaseConfigSync` pattern (standalone objects, not React components)
- Pure refactoring — zero behavior change, all views work identically
- Eliminates 6 inline `localStorage.getItem/setItem` patterns from App()
- Eliminates 8 inline `firebaseDb.ref()` calls from IssuesView
- Prepares data access layer for Phase 0.2 (new entity services)

## [8.18.6] — 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **Firebase overlay deleting local-only apps** — overlay replaced entire apps object with Firebase data, wiping apps that only existed locally. Now merges local apps into Firebase data, preserving local-only apps, repos, versions, and projects. Pushes merged config back to Firebase.

## [8.18.5] — 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **Firebase overlay overwriting correct local repos** — "always overlay" from v8.18.4 let stale Firebase repo names (`managementprod`) overwrite correct local repos (`command-center`). Overlay now preserves local repos as authoritative source of truth, pushes corrections back to Firebase.
- **Reverted migration timestamp hack** — restored `ConfigManager.save()` in migration. Overlay repo preservation handles conflicts properly.

## [8.18.4] — 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **Firebase overlay blocked by migration timestamp** — `ConfigManager.save()` during `cc_apps_v6` migration bumped `_updatedAt`, making local config "newer" than Firebase. Overlay was skipped, so hosted version never received repos. Migration save now preserves existing timestamp.
- **Always overlay Firebase config in Phase 1** — removed timestamp comparison; always apply Firebase config when it has data. Timestamp-based conflict resolution will be added in multi-user phase.

## [8.18.3] — 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **Firebase overlay overwriting locally-migrated repos** — startup overlay pulled Firebase config (with empty repo strings) and replaced local config (which had repos from `cc_apps_v6` migration). Now preserves local repo assignments when Firebase has empty values, and pushes corrected config back to Firebase automatically.
- **Diagnostic logging** — `migrateFromOldFormat()` now logs how many apps had repos synced.

## [8.18.2] — 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **Auto-detected repos not synced to Firebase** — `autoMapRepos()` wrote `testRepo`/`prodRepo` to legacy `apps` state but never back to `config.apps[id].repos`. Firebase config had empty repo strings, causing hosted Dashboard to filter out apps without repos. Now syncs detected repos back to config after auto-mapping.

## [8.18.1] — 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **Apps grouped under "Other" after Firebase sync** — `mergeWithDefaults()` schema migration was missing `project` field, so apps synced from Firebase without it defaulted to `'other'`. Added backfill from `DEFAULT_APP_DEFINITIONS` seeds.

## [8.18.0] — 2026-02-09

### Added
- **Firebase Sync Settings UI** — new "Firebase Config Sync" section in Settings with sync status, data size breakdown, last sync time, and manual Push/Pull/Clear buttons
- **Push All to Firebase** — force-overwrite all local data to Firebase from Settings
- **Pull All from Firebase** — force-overlay Firebase data onto local state from Settings
- **Clear Firebase Data** — remove all `command-center/` data from Firebase (with confirmation dialog)
- **Data size inspector** — shows total Firebase data size and per-key breakdown (config, deploy-history, etc.)
- **`FirebaseConfigSync.clearAll()`** — removes all CC data from Firebase RTDB
- **`FirebaseConfigSync.getDataSize()`** — measures approximate data size per key in Firebase
- **Debounced Firebase writes** — deploy history, session log, and deletion history use 2-second debounce to prevent rapid-fire writes during batch operations

### Changed
- **`FirebaseConfigSync.pushSmart()`** — new routing method that auto-debounces rapid-fire keys while keeping config/rules immediate
- **`pushDeployHistory()`** / **`pushSessionLog()`** / **`pushDeletionHistory()`** — now route through debounced push
- **SettingsView** — receives `syncStatus` and `onForceSync` props for sync UI integration

## [8.17.0] — 2026-02-09

### Added
- **Firebase Config Sync** — new `FirebaseConfigSync` class syncs non-sensitive CC data to Firebase RTDB at `command-center/` path
- **Dual-write pattern** — every config/history save writes to localStorage (instant) then fire-and-forget to Firebase
- **Startup overlay** — loads localStorage immediately, pulls Firebase async, overlays if newer; seeds Firebase on first run
- **Sync status indicator** — header shows ☁️ synced | 🔄 syncing | ⚡ offline | ⚠️ error
- **`_updatedAt` / `_updatedBy` timestamps** — added to config saves for conflict detection
- **`FirebaseConfigSync.pullAll()` / `pushAll()`** — bulk read/write for startup and manual sync

### Changed
- **`ConfigManager.save()`** — now dual-writes to localStorage + Firebase
- **Deploy history persistence** — dual-writes to Firebase
- **Session log persistence** — dual-writes to Firebase
- **Rules history saves** — dual-writes to Firebase (both snapshot add and delete)
- **Deletion history saves** — dual-writes to Firebase
- **Rollback snapshot persistence** — dual-writes to Firebase

## [8.16.7] — 2026-02-09

### Added
- **Google auth in header** — sign-in/out moved from Firebase page to header status bar. Shows profile photo + first name when signed in, "Sign In" link when signed out. Disabled gracefully when running locally (requires HTTPS).

## [8.16.6] — 2026-02-09

### Changed
- **Hide top Scan button on Repo Reset tab** — "Scan Repositories" button (for Stale Files/Legacy Repos) now hides when viewing Repo Reset tab to avoid confusion with "Scan All Repos"

## [8.16.5] — 2026-02-09

### Changed
- **Repo Reset bulk scan** — replaced per-app scanner with "Scan All Repos" that checks all recently-deployed apps at once. Results grouped by app/repo with Select All + batch delete. Handles directories recursively.

## [8.16.4] — 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **React Error #310 on Repo Reset** — extracted Repo Reset from inline IIFE (which broke useState hooks) into proper `RepoResetPanel` component

## [8.16.3] — 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **Running Locally link** — was hardcoded to old `managementprod` repo URL (404). Now dynamically reads command-center app's prod repo from config.

## [8.16.2] — 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **Health alert → Repo Reset navigation** — "Open Repo Reset" now lands on the Repo Reset tab instead of Stale Files, and dismisses the alert banner

## [8.16.1] — 2026-02-09

### Changed
- **Health check scoped to recent deploys** — only checks apps with successful deployments in the last 30 days, reducing API calls and noise

## [8.16.0] — 2026-02-09

### Added
- **Daily repo health check** — lightweight startup scan of all app repos (root-level) for unexpected files, runs once per 24h
- **Health alert banner** — dashboard notification showing repos with stale files, with "Open Repo Reset" and dismiss buttons

## [8.15.6] — 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **HTML deploy path from zip** — HTML files from zips with nested folders deployed to wrong path; now use filename-only as targetPath

### Added
- **Repo Reset tool** — new tab in Cleanup view; scans repo contents against expected app structure, shows expected/unexpected/total file counts, selectable unexpected files with batch delete

## [8.15.5] — 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **`setStagedFiles` scoping error** — was undefined in `DashboardView` causing `ReferenceError: Can't find variable: setStagedFiles` after doc push. Now passed as prop from `App`. This was the root cause of docs not clearing from staged files after push.

## [8.15.4] — 2026-02-09

### Changed
- **Drift banner auto-collapse** — uses `<details>` element; auto-opens only for errors/warnings, collapsed for info-only drift
- **Subdued info-only styling** — slate colors instead of blue when only info items present
- **Copy Fix Prompt** — only shown in header for errors/warnings; `e.preventDefault()` prevents details toggle

## [8.15.3] — 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **Doc files not clearing after push** — batch deploy and Deploy All modal now remove successfully pushed docs from staged files via `setStagedFiles` filter, preventing double-push loop
- **Wrong doc target path for standalone repos** — zip-derived paths like `command-center/CONTEXT.md` were used instead of root `CONTEXT.md`; default `docTargetPath` now uses `fileName` not zip `targetPath`

## [8.15.2] — 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **Seed drift** — Quotle icon (📖→💬), quotle-info name (Quotle.info→Quotle-info), CC appType (internal→public) in manifest, seeds, and app definitions
- **Copy buttons** — added 📋 Copy button inside both doc validation and config drift prompt text blocks

## [8.15.1] — 2026-02-09

### Added
- **`CC_SEED_MANIFEST`** — machine-readable JSON block in index.html capturing identity fields for all seed projects and apps, delimited by comment markers for easy parsing
- **`detectConfigDrift()`** — compares manifest from staged HTML against running config; checks gs-app-id, project names/presence, app identity fields; classifies as error/warn/info
- **Config ↔ Code Drift banner** — color-coded banner (red/orange/blue) in staged files area when deploying CC; shows all drifts with Copy Fix Prompt button and expandable Claude prompt

## [8.15.0] — 2026-02-09

### Changed
- **App identity rename: management → command-center** — full rename across all code, seeds, detection, mappings, and UI defaults
- **Page title** — "Command Center" (was "Game Shelf Command Center")
- **gs-app-id meta tag** — `command-center` (was `management`)
- **DEFAULT_APP_DEFINITIONS** — key and id changed to `command-center`
- **Hardcoded fallback detection** — legacy signature updated
- **Default deploy target** — `command-center` (was `management`)
- **Repo-to-app-id mappings** — Smart Deploy + Claude Prep updated
- **Internal tools list** — Projects view updated
- **Console startup log** — now shows v8.15.0

### Added
- **localStorage migration** — `mergeWithDefaults()` auto-renames `management` → `command-center` in stored config

## [8.14.2] — 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **Batch deploy controls** — now correctly split deploy files from push-doc files; shows "Deploy 1 file + Push 6 docs" instead of treating all files as deploy targets
- **Doc files inherit primaryApp** — post-extraction assigns detected app from index.html to all doc files in the same zip package
- **Batch action handler** — refactored into single `executeBatchAction()` that deploys files to Pages AND pushes docs to source repo in one click

## [8.14.1] — 2026-02-09

### Added
- **`validateDocPackage()`** — checks staged files for missing required docs and version alignment between deploy files and doc headers
- **Doc validation banner** — amber warning banner in staged files area showing missing docs, version mismatches, and expandable Claude fix prompt
- **Copy Fix Prompt** — one-click button copies a pre-written prompt for Claude with specific files and versions to fix
- **Per-file doc indicators** — green ✓ or amber ⚠️ inline on each doc file card showing version alignment status

## [8.14.0] — 2026-02-09

### Added
- **Unified deploy + push docs** — files dropped on dashboard auto-classified as deploy (`.html/.js/.json`) or push-doc (`.md/.txt`); both handled in single "Deploy All" flow
- **`classifyFileAction()`** — helper that routes files by name/extension; known doc files → `push-doc`, `SESSION_BRIEF.md` → `skip`, deploy files → `deploy`
- **Staged file visual distinction** — doc files show cyan "📄 Push to repo:" label; deploy files show standard "Deploy as:"
- **DeployAllModal** — now shows two sections: "🚀 Deploy to GitHub Pages" and "📄 Push docs to repo" with separate counts and adaptive button text
- **Batch doc push** — groups docs by app, checks SHA for existing files, commits via GitHub API
- **File input accepts .md/.txt** — upload and drop zone now accept doc files

## [8.13.2.0] — 2026-02-09

### Changed
- **Config as source of truth** — `mergeWithDefaults()` no longer force-merges `DEFAULT_APP_DEFINITIONS` into stored apps on every load; seed data used only for first-time initialization
- **Schema migration** — `mergeWithDefaults()` now only ensures structural fields exist (repos, versions, createdAt, detectionPatterns) without overwriting user values

### Removed
- **`DEFAULT_APP_DEFINITIONS` runtime fallbacks** — 8 references across deploy, Smart Deploy, version checking, and Projects views replaced with `config.apps[appId]`
- **`subPath` fallback pattern** — `DEFAULT_APP_DEFINITIONS[appId]?.subPath` fallback removed from all 8 locations; simplified to `app.subPath || ''`
- **`SEED_PROJECTS` force-merge** — existing stored projects are no longer merged with seed definitions on every load

## [8.13.1.7] — 2026-02-09

### Changed
- **Command Center project independence** — `management` app seed now defaults to `project: 'command-center'` (was `'gameshelf'`), icon updated to 🏗️, `repoPatterns` updated to `command-center` / `command-center-test`
- **SEED_PROJECTS** — added `command-center` project definition (🏗️, cyan), re-ordered existing projects

## [8.13.1.6] — 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **Version scanner false positives** — extracted `SEED_VERSION` constant for `generateInitialHTML()` and `generateAdminHTML()` scaffolding; `0.1.0` no longer appears as literal meta/footer versions in CC source
- **shouldSkip() lookback range** — increased from 500 to 1000 chars to catch `generate*()` function declarations further from their template content
- **Placeholder version patterns** — `X.X.X` / `X.Y.Z` format auto-skipped as obvious non-versions

## [8.13.1.5] — 2026-02-07

### Added
- **Project emoji picker** — categorized emoji grid in ProjectEditModal, same UX as app modal

## [8.13.1.2] — 2026-02-07

### Fixed

## [8.13.1.1] — 2026-02-07

### Added
- **Zip support for Push Docs** — drop a .zip package and all .md/.txt files are extracted automatically. Deduplicates by filename.

## [8.13.1.0] — 2026-02-07

### Added

## [8.13.0.9] — 2026-02-07

### Fixed

- Exposed `window.__CC_APPS` for detection function access outside React

## [8.13.0.8] — 2026-02-07

### Fixed
