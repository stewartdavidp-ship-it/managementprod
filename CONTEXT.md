# Command Center — CONTEXT.md

> **Read this first** at the start of every session working on Command Center.

## Current Version

**v8.48.1** — Released 2026-02-11

## What Command Center Is

Command Center is an internal tool for managing the Game Shelf ecosystem of web applications. It handles:

- **Deployment** — Drag-and-drop deploy packages to GitHub Pages repos (with GitHub API)
- **Version tracking** — Reads `<meta name="version">` from deployed sites
- **App detection** — Auto-identifies which app a file belongs to via regex patterns
- **Project management** — Groups apps under project umbrellas
- **Firebase monitoring** — Checks Firebase RTDB status
- **Firebase admin** — Service account-based admin access to rules, functions, and logs (NEW v8.9.0)
- **User/beta management** — Tracks beta testers and referral system
- **Issue tracking** — Links bugs to app versions
- **Session logging** — Records deploy history and session activity

## Architecture

- **Single HTML file** — All CSS, JS, React inline (~1.8MB, ~31,700 lines)
- **React via CDN** — React 18 + ReactDOM loaded from unpkg
- **No build step** — Runs directly from file:// or GitHub Pages
- **GitHub API** — All repo/deploy operations use personal access token
- **Firebase** — Uses word-boxing-default-rtdb for shared data
- **Firebase Admin** — Service account JWT → OAuth2 token for rules/functions/logs APIs (NEW v8.9.0)
- **LocalStorage** — Config, deploy history, project states, collapse states, service account key

## Recent Changes (This Session)

### v8.48.1 — SESSION_RETURN.json: Structured Session Handoff
Three-phase implementation of a structured handoff contract for Claude sessions.

**Phase A: Brief Generation**
- All 8 SESSION_TYPES updated with `SESSION_RETURN.json` in deliveryRequirements
- SessionBriefGenerator embeds full JSON schema in generated briefs with pre-filled sessionType and sessionId
- classifyFileAction treats SESSION_RETURN.json as 'skip' (not pushed to repo)

**Phase B: Auto-Review Processing**
- SESSION_RETURN.json detection in both ZIP extraction and single-file drop paths
- `validateSessionReturn()` — full schema validation: required fields (version, sessionType, timestamp, summary), enum checks, type validation
- `matchSessionReturn()` — 3-tier confidence matching: session ID → work item overlap → type + recency
- `AutoReviewModal` component — displays parsed manifest with editable work item statuses, toggleable issue/idea creation, interface change flags, breaking change warnings, file summary
- Apply handler: updates work item statuses via WorkItemService, creates new work items for discovered issues/ideas (source: 'session-return'), completes session review, stores `returnManifest` metadata on session record, logs activity

**Phase C: Integration Polish**
- Session record creation moved before brief generation so session ID is embedded in the return manifest schema
- `sessionId` field added to SESSION_RETURN_SCHEMA and matchSessionReturn (highest-confidence match)
- SessionBriefGenerator accepts `sessionId` in options, pre-fills in schema
- Session history shows cyan `⚡ Auto-Reviewed` badge on sessions processed via SESSION_RETURN.json
- Expanded session details display return manifest section with version bump, issue/idea/interface change counts, and application timestamp
- Pending return manifest banner in Sessions view with "Open Auto-Review" button
- `pendingSessionReturn` / `setPendingSessionReturn` state threaded from App → SessionLogView

### v8.47.0 — Domain Management
- FirebaseAdmin: getAuthConfig(), getAuthorizedDomains(), updateAuthorizedDomains(), addAuthorizedDomain(), removeAuthorizedDomain()
- testConnection() updated with 4th check for auth config
- AuthorizedDomainsManager component in Settings
- GitHubPagesDomainManager component with DNS health checks

### v8.46.0 — Unified Plan Phase 5.6–5.7: Activity Feed Multi-Person View + Multi-Person Access
- **Activity Feed View (Phase 5.6)** — New "📡 Activity Feed" sub-tab in Session Log alongside Session Log and Session History. Full-page activity timeline with:
  - Stats row: total events, contributors, deploys, sessions
  - Team Activity panel (shows when multiple actors) with per-person deploy/session/item counts and avatar display
  - Filters: by actor, app, action type, stream — all combinable with clear button
  - Day-grouped timeline with action-colored entries, hover metadata, actor avatars, and timestamps
  - Empty state with guidance
- **TeamService (Phase 5.7)** — New Firebase service (`command-center/{uid}/team` and `command-center/{uid}/teamMembership`) for multi-person workspace access:
  - Roles: owner (full access + team management), editor (create/edit), viewer (read-only)
  - `invite(ownerUid, email, role)` — creates pending invite keyed by email hash
  - `acceptInvite(ownerUid, memberUid, profile)` — resolves pending invite to real UID, writes membership pointer
  - `updateRole()`, `remove()` — role management and member removal
  - `getWorkspaceUid()` — returns owner's UID for team members (all data lives under owner's path)
  - `canEdit()`, `canManageTeam()` — permission checks
  - `generateRulesTemplate()` — Firebase security rules template for team access
- **Team Management UI** — New "👥 Team" section in Settings after Your Name:
  - Owner view: current user display, team member list with role dropdowns and remove buttons, invite form (email + role), pending invite status
  - Member view: shows role and workspace name (team management handled by owner)
  - Firebase security rules template (expandable) with copy button
- **Workspace identity** — `workspaceUid` computed in App component — when user is a team member, returns owner's UID so all Firebase reads/writes target the shared workspace
- **canEdit** permission flag — computed from teamMembership, ready for viewer-mode enforcement
- **Header indicators** — Team member count badge (👥 N) for owners with active members; role badge for team members viewing shared workspace
- **State management** — `teamMembers`, `teamMembership` state in App component with Firebase listeners; cleanup on sign-out and unmount

### v8.45.0 — Unified Plan Phase 5.5: Product Brief Auto-Generation
- **ProductBriefGenerator** — New service that auto-generates `PRODUCT_BRIEF.md` from existing CC data sources: scope answers (from `appScopes/{appId}`), work items, deploy history, streams, and lifecycle metadata. Assembles a PM-language product description with sections for Product Identity, Key Product Decisions, Feature Inventory (shipped/in-progress/planned/ideas), Work Streams overview, Recent Releases, and Open Decisions.
- **PRODUCT_BRIEF.md in Claude Prep packages** — Auto-generated after CLAUDE_INSTRUCTIONS.md during package build. Included per session type context strategy: `alwaysInclude` for design and research sessions (product context critical), `preferInclude` for build, fix, test, review, polish, and document sessions.
- **ProductBriefModal** — 📄 button on each app row in ProjectsTab. Lightweight modal renders the generated brief as formatted markdown with copy-to-clipboard. Regenerates on open (always reflects current state, not cached).
- **Key Product Decisions formatting** — `_formatProductDecisions()` translates scoping category answers from technical values to PM language (e.g. `dataPersistence: 'firebase'` → "Saves to cloud (syncs across devices)"). Covers game, tool, dashboard, content, and admin categories.
- **Feature Inventory** — `_generateFeatureInventory()` organizes work items by status (✅ Shipped, 🔄 In Progress, 📋 Planned, 💡 Ideas, 🐛 Known Issues). Falls back to scope `v1Features` for apps without work items yet.
- **classifyFileAction** updated — PRODUCT_BRIEF.md treated as 'skip' (auto-generated, don't push to repo)
- **Environment Optimization** — PRODUCT_BRIEF.md added to doc listing and token estimation (~3,000 tokens)

### v8.44.0 — Unified Plan Phase 5.4: Dependencies Auto-Remediation & Prompt Chaining
- **DependencyAlertService** — New Firebase service (`command-center/{uid}/dependencyAlerts`) for dependency alert lifecycle management (pending → updated/no_impact)
- **triggerAlerts()** — Orchestrated auto-remediation flow: finds dependencies consuming a changed interface → creates dependency_update work items in dependent streams with full change context → creates alert records → marks dependencies as 'changed' → logs to activity feed
- **Post-Session Review interface change detection** — Step 1 (Overview) shows checklist of provided interfaces that have dependents; user checks changed interfaces, describes changes, and triggers alerts. Results panel shows auto-created work items in dependent streams.
- **Prompt chaining in SessionBriefGenerator** — When a session targets dependency_update work items, the brief includes a "Dependency Changes — Context from Source Session" section with change description, affected interfaces, source work item, and notes from the triggering session. This is the core prompt chain: previous session's output becomes this session's input.
- **WorkStreamsView alert visibility** — Stream cards show pending dependency alerts (amber badge), summary stats include Pending Alerts count, handleResolveAlert() resolves alerts as 'updated' or 'no_impact'
- **Dependency status tracking** — Dependencies gain 'changed' status when alert fires, move back to 'verified' when resolved as 'updated'
- **globalDependencyAlerts** state added to App component with Firebase listener
- **Props threading** — SessionLogView and PostSessionReviewModal receive streams/interfaces/dependencies/alerts; WorkStreamsView receives globalDependencyAlerts

### v8.43.0 — Unified Plan Phase 5.1–5.3: Work Streams, Decoupling, Unified Model
- **WorkStreamService** — New Firebase service (`command-center/{uid}/streams`) for creating, managing, and tracking named work streams with owner, goal, status (active/paused/blocked/complete), target release, and blockedBy relationships
- **StreamInterfaceService** — New Firebase service (`command-center/{uid}/interfaces`) for stream-provided interfaces (behavior/output/data/naming/timing contracts)
- **DependencyService** — New Firebase service (`command-center/{uid}/dependencies`) for declared dependencies between streams with status tracking (active/changed/verified)
- **WorkStreamsView** — New top-level view (📋 Backlog → 🔀 Streams) with stream board showing per-app stream cards, completion bars, work item summaries, interface/dependency displays, status management, and create/edit/delete operations
- **StreamEditModal** — Create/edit streams with name, app, owner, goal, target release, status, and blockedBy stream selection
- **Phase 5.3 Unified Work Item Model** — `streamId` field added to WorkItemService (create + batch create), enabling work items to be assigned to streams
- **WorkItemEditModal stream selector** — Stream dropdown appears when app has streams, allowing items to be assigned/unassigned
- **BacklogView stream grouping** — New "Group: Stream" option in backlog grouping, stream badges on items when not grouped by stream
- **ClaudePrepModal stream filter** — Stream dropdown in Step 1 filters work items by stream for focused session prep
- **SessionBriefGenerator stream context** — Session briefs include stream name/owner/goal when targeted items belong to a stream
- **Phase 5.1 Decouple from Game Shelf** — Skills recommendations now project-aware (only recommend gs-active for Game Shelf project apps, not universally); gs-logos skill only for GS apps; platform recommendations text genericized
- **Extensible categories** — `getAllCategories(config)` helper merges built-in SCOPE_CATEGORIES with `config.customCategories` for future custom category support
- **Global state** — `globalStreams`, `globalInterfaces`, `globalDependencies` added to App component with Firebase listeners
- **Navigation** — 🔀 Streams added to Backlog dropdown (alongside Backlog and Releases)

### v8.41.0 — Unified Plan Phase 4: Dashboard Polish (Phase 4.1–4.3)
- **Product Health dashboard** — DashboardView sidebar redesigned from deploy-focused to product-focused with: Features Shipped (30d), Pipeline count, Session-Ready apps, Cost per Feature metrics with progressive disclosure tooltips
- **Smart Quick Actions** — Sidebar actions aligned to product workflow: Start Session (auto-targets most-ready app), Add Idea (→ Backlog), Review Session (shows pending count), Smart Deploy
- **Header Quick Actions updated** — Add Idea, Smart Deploy, Portfolio access replace old deploy-centric buttons; Deploy Staged only shows when files staged
- **Pipeline Health panel** — Horizontal status bar (Idea/Ready/WIP/Review) with active work items list, replaces old 5-column backlog grid
- **Recent Activity feed** — Chronological activity events in sidebar from ActivityLogService with action icons and relative timestamps
- **Progressive disclosure** — App Pipeline and Issues/Shipped widgets collapsed into `<details>` elements (below the fold per plan). Hover tooltips on metrics show breakdown details
- **Portfolio View enhanced** — Features Shipped stat added to top stats row (5 columns), product-focused layout
- **Demoted content** — Maturity distribution, session mix, deploy counts pushed below primary product health metrics per Unified Plan spec

### v8.26.0 — Claude Session Wizard (Phase 2.2)
- **4-step wizard flow** — ClaudePrepModal rewritten from single-phase configure-and-build into guided wizard: Step 1 (Work Items) → Step 2 (Session Type) → Step 3 (Context Budget Preview) → Step 4 (Generate+Download)
- **Visual step indicator** — Clickable progress bar with green checkmarks for completed steps
- **Context budget preview (Step 3)** — Pre-build preview showing which files will be included/preferred/skipped based on session type context strategy and engine context window
- **Work item auto-transition** — On package generation, selected work items with status "ready" automatically transition to "in-progress" via WorkItemService
- **Session record creation** — On package generation, creates session record via SessionService with app ID, session type, work item IDs, engine, token count, file list
- **Session-type-aware file filtering** — During build, respects contextStrategy: skips docs in `skipWhenTight`, omits source files when `includeSource: false`, logs all filtering decisions
- **Quick skip** — "Skip wizard — Quick package" button on Step 1 preserves fast path for quick builds
- **firebaseUid prop threading** — App → ProjectsTab → ClaudePrepModal for Firebase write operations

### v8.25.0 — Session Types + Enhanced Brief Generator (Phase 2.1)
- **SESSION_TYPES** — 8 session type definitions (Build, Design, Fix, Test, Research, Review, Polish, Document) each with: description, suggested engine, role frame, scope rules, delivery requirements, context strategy (which files to include/skip), work item focus, auto-suggest mapping
- **SessionBriefGenerator** — New module replacing `generateSessionBrief()`. Produces session-type-aware briefs with role frame, scope rules, delivery requirements, target work item details (criteria, files, dependencies), other open items summary, maturity context. Old function is now a thin wrapper for backward compatibility.
- **ClaudePrepModal enhanced** — New configure phase before building: session type grid selector (8 types), work item targeting (checkbox list of open items for app), context strategy preview (always/prefer/skip file lists), auto-suggest session type from first selected work item. "Skip — Quick package" option preserved for fast use.
- **Settings enhanced** — Session type → engine recommendation grid now uses SESSION_TYPES with icons and descriptions
- **Props threading** — `globalWorkItems` now passed through App → ProjectsTab → ClaudePrepModal

### v8.24.0 — CLAUDE_INSTRUCTIONS.md + Backlog Polish (Phase 1.3)
- **generateClaudeInstructions()** — Produces CLAUDE_INSTRUCTIONS.md from scope data with sections: Project Identity, V1 Scope, Starting Standards (grouped), Key Decisions, Architecture Constraints, CC Integration, Session Protocol
- **STANDARD_DESCRIPTIONS** — Map of 38 standard IDs to full requirement-statement descriptions
- **CLAUDE_INSTRUCTIONS.md in Claude Prep** — Generated from Firebase scope data when not in repo (Step 3.25)
- **Issue → Work Item promotion** — Promote button in IssuesView creates work items from issues

### v8.23.0 — Project Scoping Flow (Phase 1.2)
- **ProjectScopeModal** — 4-step scoping wizard (Describe → Clarify → Features → Standards) captures project intent through category-driven questions
- **Category question sets** — Static data for 5 categories (Game, Tool, Dashboard, Content, Admin) with toggles, selects, multi-selects
- **Feature pre-population** — `generateFeaturesFromScope()` auto-generates V1 features from category + answers
- **Starting standards assembly** — 12 universal + 24 conditional standards assembled from scoping selections
- **Auto-generate work items** — Scope save creates batch work items via `WorkItemService.createBatch()`
- **BacklogView integration** — "🎯 Scope Work" dropdown button for per-app scope initiation
- **SetupNewAppView** — Expanded to 5-step wizard with new Step 2 "Scope" and quick-setup skip option
- **Firebase scope storage** — Scope data at `command-center/{uid}/appScopes/{appId}`

### v8.22.0 — Backlog View + Work Item CRUD (Phase 1.1)
- **BacklogView** — New top-level navigation tab with full work item management: create, edit, delete, status transitions (idea→ready→in-progress→review→done→deferred)
- **WorkItemEditModal** — Full-featured modal for all WorkItemService fields: app, title, description, type, priority, status, effort, acceptance criteria, tags, and context (files affected, sections, dependencies, notes)
- **Grouping & filtering** — Group by app/status/type, filter by status/type/app, search by title/description/ID/tags, sort by priority/status/effort/type/creation date
- **Bulk operations** — Multi-select with bulk status update
- **Quick status transitions** — One-click status buttons on each item row

- **Global work items state** — App component subscribes to WorkItemService alongside global issues

### v8.21.1 — AI Engines + Token Integration (Phase 0.3)
- AI Engines settings section with default engine selector and comparison table
- Token estimation integrated into Claude Prep (per-file counts, budget bar, over-budget recommendations, file manifest table)

### v8.18.6 — Fix: Firebase Overlay Deleting Local-Only Apps
- **Full merge overlay** — local-only apps, repos, versions, and projects are preserved during Firebase overlay and pushed back to Firebase automatically

### v8.18.5 — Fix: Firebase Overlay Overwriting Correct Local Repos
- **Overlay preserves local repos as authoritative** — changed from "fill empty only" to "prefer local when local has a value". Prevents stale Firebase repo names from overwriting correct local assignments. Pushes corrections back to Firebase.
- **Reverted migration timestamp hack** — restored `ConfigManager.save()` in migration

### v8.18.4 — Fix: Firebase Overlay Blocked by Migration Timestamp
- **Migration save preserves timestamp** — `cc_apps_v6` migration no longer calls `ConfigManager.save()` (which bumped `_updatedAt`), instead writes directly to localStorage preserving existing timestamp
- **Always overlay in Phase 1** — removed timestamp comparison from startup overlay; always applies Firebase config when available. Conflict resolution deferred to multi-user phase.

### v8.18.3 — Fix: Firebase Overlay Overwriting Local Repos
- **Overlay repo preservation** — startup overlay now preserves locally-populated repos when Firebase has empty strings, then pushes corrected config back to Firebase automatically
- **Diagnostic logging** — `migrateFromOldFormat()` logs repo sync count

### v8.18.2 — Fix: Auto-Detected Repos Not Synced to Config
- **Repo sync-back** — `autoMapRepos()` now writes detected `testRepo`/`prodRepo` back to `config.apps[id].repos` and calls `ConfigManager.save()`. Previously repos only lived in the legacy `apps` state (`cc_apps_v6`) and never made it into `cc_config_v3`, so Firebase config had empty repo strings and the hosted Dashboard filtered out those apps.

### v8.18.1 — Fix: Project Field Missing After Sync
- **`mergeWithDefaults()` schema migration** — added `project` field backfill from `DEFAULT_APP_DEFINITIONS` seeds. Apps synced from Firebase without a `project` field were defaulting to `'other'`, causing the Dashboard to group everything under "Other".

### v8.18.0 — Firebase Sync Settings UI + Debounced Writes
- **Firebase Sync section in Settings** — new UI panel showing sync status, Firebase data size (total + per-key breakdown), last manual sync time, and action buttons
- **Push All to Firebase** — force-overwrite all local data to Firebase from Settings
- **Pull All from Firebase** — force-overlay Firebase data onto local state from Settings
- **Clear Firebase Data** — remove all `command-center/` data from Firebase RTDB (with window.confirm dialog)
- **`FirebaseConfigSync.clearAll()`** — removes all CC data from Firebase
- **`FirebaseConfigSync.getDataSize()`** — measures approximate data size per key
- **Debounced writes** — deploy history, session log, deletion history use 2-second debounce (`pushSmart()`) to avoid hammering RTDB during batch deploys
- **`pushSmart()` routing** — auto-selects debounced vs immediate push based on data key
- **SettingsView** receives `syncStatus` and `onForceSync` props

### v8.17.0 — Firebase Config Sync
- New `FirebaseConfigSync` class — syncs non-sensitive CC data to Firebase RTDB at `command-center/` path
- Dual-write pattern: every save writes to localStorage (instant) then fire-and-forget to Firebase
- Startup overlay: loads localStorage immediately, pulls Firebase async, overlays if newer
- First-run seed: if Firebase is empty, pushes all local data up to initialize
- Sync status indicator in header: ☁️ synced | 🔄 syncing | ⚡ offline | ⚠️ error
- Data synced: config (apps/projects/envs), deploy history, rules history, session log, deletion history, rollback snapshots
- Secrets stay in localStorage only: GitHub PAT, Firebase SA key, API keys
- Open read/write Firebase rules for now; lock down in multi-user phase
- Foundation for future multi-user CRUD access to CC configuration

### v8.16.2 — Health Alert → Repo Reset Navigation
- "Open Repo Reset" button now auto-selects the Repo Reset tab via `cleanupInitialTab` state passed to CleanupView. Also dismisses the alert banner.

### v8.16.1 — Health Check Scoped to Recent Deploys
- Only checks apps deployed in the last 30 days (reads from `cc_history_v2` deployment history)
- Logs which apps are being checked: `[HealthCheck] Checking 5 recently deployed apps: command-center, quotle, ...`

### v8.16.0 — Daily Repo Health Check
- **Startup health check** — after version refresh, scans all app repos (root-level only, lightweight) for unexpected files/directories. Runs once per 24 hours (tracked via `cc_repo_health_last` in localStorage).
- **Health alert banner** — shows on dashboard if issues found. Lists each repo with unexpected file count and names. "Open Repo Reset" button navigates to Cleanup → Repo Reset tab. Dismiss button hides until next check.
- **Repo Reset tool** (from v8.15.6) — full recursive scan of selected repo, expected vs unexpected file comparison, batch delete.

### v8.15.6 — Fix: HTML Deploy Path from Zip + Repo Reset Tool
- **Root cause fix:** HTML files from zips with nested folders deployed to wrong paths. Now always use filename-only as `targetPath`.
- **Repo Reset tool** — new tab in Cleanup view. Select an app + target (test/prod), scan the repo, see expected vs unexpected files side by side. Select All + delete to clean up stale/misplaced files. Shows summary cards (expected / unexpected / total), collapsible expected files list, selectable unexpected files with delete button, and deletion log.

### v8.15.5 — Fix: setStagedFiles Scoping Error
- **Root cause:** `setStagedFiles` was defined in `App()` but used in `DashboardView` (a child component) without being passed as a prop. The batch deploy controls' `executeBatchAction` called `setStagedFiles` to clear pushed docs, but it was undefined in DashboardView's scope.
- **Fix:** Added `setStagedFiles` as a prop to `DashboardView` and passed it from the `App` render.
- This was the cause of the "Push 6 Docs" button reappearing after deploy — docs pushed successfully but the staged files list never updated.

### v8.15.4 — Drift Banner Auto-Collapse
- **Collapsible drift banner** — uses `<details>` element. Auto-opens (`open` attribute) only when errors or warnings are present. Info-only drift (config-only apps) renders as a collapsed one-liner showing count.
- **Subdued info-only styling** — when only info items exist, banner uses `bg-slate-800/50 border-slate-700/50` and `text-slate-400` instead of blue, making it unobtrusive.
- **Copy Fix Prompt button** — only shown in the summary row when there are critical issues (errors/warnings). Uses `e.preventDefault()` to avoid toggling the `<details>`.

### v8.15.3 — Doc Push Bug Fixes
- **Fixed doc files not clearing after push** — both batch deploy controls and Deploy All modal now remove successfully pushed docs from staged files, preventing the "push again" loop.
- **Fixed wrong doc target path** — standalone repo docs (CC, LabelKeeper) were getting zip-derived paths like `command-center/CONTEXT.md` instead of root `CONTEXT.md`. Default `docTargetPath` now starts from `fileName` not `targetPath`.

### v8.15.2 — Drift Fixes + Copy Buttons
- **Fixed 3 seed drift items** — Quotle icon 📖→💬, quotle-info project name Quotle.info→Quotle-info, CC appType internal→public. Updated in CC_SEED_MANIFEST, DEFAULT_APP_DEFINITIONS, and SEED_PROJECTS.
- **Copy buttons on prompt text** — both doc validation and config drift "Show Claude fix prompt" sections now have a 📋 Copy button positioned inside the prompt `<pre>` block.

### v8.15.1 — Config ↔ Code Drift Detection
- **`CC_SEED_MANIFEST`** — machine-readable JSON block embedded in index.html between `/* CC_SEED_MANIFEST_START */` and `/* CC_SEED_MANIFEST_END */` markers. Contains identity fields for all seed projects and apps (name, project, icon, subPath, appType, hasServiceWorker).
- **`detectConfigDrift()`** — parses manifest from staged HTML, compares against running config. Checks: gs-app-id existence, project name/presence, app identity fields (name, project, icon, subPath, appType, hasServiceWorker). Classifies drifts as error/warn/info.
- **Drift banner** — shown in staged files area when deploying CC itself. Color-coded by severity (red/orange/blue). Shows all drifts with expandable Claude fix prompt.
- **Copy Fix Prompt** — one-click copies a detailed prompt for Claude listing all mismatches with field names, code values, and config values, plus instruction to update seeds.
- Only activates on CC self-deploy — detects `CC_SEED_MANIFEST` in staged index.html content.

### v8.15.0 — App Identity Rename: management → command-center
- **Full app ID rename** — `management` → `command-center` across all code. CC is now a standalone app with its own identity, not a sub-app of Game Shelf.
- **`<meta name="gs-app-id">` updated** — now `command-center` (was `management`)
- **`<title>` updated** — now "Command Center" (was "Game Shelf Command Center")
- **`DEFAULT_APP_DEFINITIONS` key** — `command-center` with `id: 'command-center'`
- **Hardcoded fallback detection** — legacy signature id updated
- **Default deploy target** — `appId: 'command-center'`
- **Repo-to-app-id mappings** — both Smart Deploy and Claude Prep mappings updated
- **Internal tools list** — updated for Projects view
- **Deploy instructions** — references `command-center-test` repo (was `managementtest`)
- **localStorage migration** — `mergeWithDefaults()` automatically renames `management` → `command-center` in stored config on first load. Old deployment history referencing `management` appId will still display correctly since history is read-only.

### v8.14.2 — Deploy + Docs UX Fixes
- **Batch deploy controls split** — "Deploy N files" section now correctly separates deploy files from push-doc files. Shows "Deploy 1 file + Push 6 docs" instead of "Deploy 7 selected files".
- **Doc files inherit primaryApp** — post-extraction step assigns the detected app (from index.html) to all doc files in the same zip, so doc files correctly associate with the right app.
- **Batch action refactored** — single `executeBatchAction()` handles both deploy-to-Pages and push-docs-to-repo in one button click, with proper logging.

### v8.36.0 — Unified Package Validation Engine
- **Selection-driven validation** — `validatePackage()` replaces 4 separate validation mechanisms (post-extraction alerts, doc validation banner, deploy-time confirms, version warning modal). Validation runs on selected files via intent detection.
- **Intent detection** — `getValidationIntent()` classifies uploads as `quick-deploy`, `targeted-update`, `deploy-package`, `full-package`, or `docs-only` based on selected file composition. Only checks relevant to the intent are run.
- **Inline validation panel** — replaces all modals/alerts. Three visual tiers: grey (info, collapsed), amber (warning, expanded), red (error, expanded). Panel sits in deploy controls between app selector and deploy button.
- **Version bump in CC** — code-only deploys (no docs) get a bump button directly in the panel. Updates all version strings in index.html and sw.js CACHE_VERSION in one click. Custom version input also available.
- **Claude prompt for full packages** — when docs are included, version bumps and doc updates are sent back to Claude via copyable prompt. No in-CC bump offered (Claude handles everything together).
- **Deploy button state machine** — button styling driven by validation severity: normal (clean/info), amber (warnings), disabled+greyed (errors). Error override via checkbox re-enables as red "Force Deploy".
- **`generateClaudeFixPrompt()`** — builds contextual fix prompt with grouped sections (version issues, PWA completeness, missing docs, doc version alignment).

#### Removed
- `validateDocPackage()` and its `useMemo` / amber banner UI
- Post-extraction `showAlert()` calls for version mismatch and PWA incompleteness
- Deploy-time `showConfirm()` dialogs for version issues and same-version deploys
- `VersionWarningModal` trigger (component retained but dead code)
- Per-file doc version alignment indicators (green/amber on file cards)

### v8.14.1 — Doc Package Validation (replaced by v8.36.0)
- ~~`validateDocPackage()`~~ — replaced by unified `validatePackage()` with intent-based validation.
- ~~Validation banner~~ — replaced by inline panel in deploy controls.
- ~~Copy Fix Prompt button~~ — preserved in new unified panel.
- ~~Per-file indicators~~ — removed (redundant with unified panel).

### v8.14.0 — Unified Deploy + Push Docs
- **File action classification** — files dropped on the deploy dashboard are auto-classified: `.html/.js/.json/.css` → deploy to GitHub Pages; `.md/.txt` → push to source repo. Classification uses `classifyFileAction()` which checks against `CLAUDE_PREP_DOCS` list and file extensions.
- **Staged file visual distinction** — doc files show cyan "📄 Push to repo:" label instead of "Deploy as:". Deploy files show the normal deploy UI.
- **Deploy All handles both** — "Deploy All" modal now groups files into "🚀 Deploy" and "📄 Push docs" sections with separate counts. Button text adapts: "Deploy 1 + Push 6 Docs".
- **Batch doc push execution** — docs are grouped by app, SHA-checked against repo, and committed via GitHub API with "Update/Add {name} via Command Center" messages.
- **File upload accepts .md/.txt** — file input and drop zone now accept doc files directly.
- **SESSION_BRIEF.md auto-skipped** — auto-generated files filtered out during staging.

### v8.13.2.0 — Config as Source of Truth
- **Stored config is authoritative** — `mergeWithDefaults()` no longer force-merges `DEFAULT_APP_DEFINITIONS` into stored apps on every load. Seed data is only used for first-time initialization (empty config). After that, `config.apps` and `config.projects` are the sole source of truth.
- **Removed all `DEFAULT_APP_DEFINITIONS` runtime fallbacks** — 8 references removed across deploy, Smart Deploy, version checking, and Projects views. All now read from `config.apps[appId]` directly.
- **Removed `subPath` fallback pattern** — `app.subPath || DEFAULT_APP_DEFINITIONS[appId]?.subPath || ''` simplified to `app.subPath || ''` everywhere. Stored apps always have subPath populated.
- **Schema migration only** — `mergeWithDefaults()` now only ensures structural fields exist on stored apps (repos, versions, createdAt, detectionPatterns) without overwriting any user values.

### v8.13.1.7 — Command Center Project Independence
- **SEED_PROJECTS** — added `command-center` project (🏗️, cyan) to seed definitions, re-ordered other projects
- **DEFAULT_APP_DEFINITIONS** — `management` app now defaults to `project: 'command-center'` instead of `'gameshelf'`, with correct `repoPatterns` pointing to `command-center` and `command-center-test` repos, icon updated to 🏗️, and `repos.test` added
- Previously CC defaulted under Game Shelf project, requiring manual re-assignment after each config migration

### v8.13.1.6 — Version Scanner Fix
- **SEED_VERSION constant** — `0.1.0` seed version extracted from `generateInitialHTML()` and `generateAdminHTML()` template literals into a constant. Template now uses `${SEED_VERSION}` so the version scanner skips it (existing `${}` detection in `shouldSkip()`). Eliminates 4 false-positive "Version Issues Detected" warnings on CC self-deploy.
- **shouldSkip enhancement** — increased lookback window from 500→1000 chars for `generate*()` function detection; added `X.X.X`/`X.Y.Z` placeholder pattern skip.

### v8.13.1.x — Push Docs & Detection Improvements
- **Push Docs to Repo** — new feature in Claude Prep modal. Drop .md/.txt files or a .zip package, CC extracts docs, checks repo for existing files (🔄 update vs 🆕 create), and pushes via GitHub API. Clear progress states: staging → pushing (animated) → ✅ done banner.
- **Extra docs scanning** — Claude Prep now scans repo for additional .md files beyond the standard 4 (e.g. DATA_MODEL.md, UX_LAYERS.md) and includes them in the package. Follows the CLAUDE-PREP-STANDARD: "extras are included in Claude Prep packages when present in the repo."
- **Dynamic app detection** — `detectAppFromContent()` now checks configurable detection patterns from app config (scored by specificity) before falling back to hardcoded legacy signatures. Fixes "Rungs Builder detected as Rungs" issue.
- **`window.__CC_APPS`** — apps state exposed to window for detection function access.

### v8.13.0.x — App Configuration Improvements
- **Sub Path field** in AppEditModal for apps in subdirectories within shared repos
- **Repository Assignment dropdowns** — select from actual GitHub repos instead of typing patterns. Repos grouped as "Shared" (shows which apps use them) vs "Available". Auto-derives patterns from selection. Preview path display.
- **Projects promoted to main nav** — 5 sections: Deploy → Projects → Monitor → Maintain → Configure
- **Emoji picker** on both App and Project edit modals — categorized grid, click to select
- **Auto-generated detection patterns** — generates title, kebab-case, camelCase, UPPER_CASE patterns as you type app name
- **Project emoji picker** — added to ProjectEditModal with same categorized grid

### v8.13.0 — Claude Prep (Session Prep per App)
- **Claude Prep button (🤖)** added to every app row in ProjectsTab
- `ClaudePrepModal` — new modal component that assembles a context package for starting a Claude session:
  1. Fetches app source files from GitHub repo (index.html, sw.js, manifest.json for PWAs)
  2. Fetches project docs from repo (CONTEXT.md, PROJECT_PLAN.md, CHANGELOG.md, RELEASE_NOTES.txt, ARCHITECTURE.md)
  3. Generates `SESSION_BRIEF.md` from CC live data (versions, recent deploys, open issues, app config)
  4. Bundles everything into a downloadable `{app}-project-v{X.X.X}.zip`
- **Bootstrap on first use:** When docs don't exist in the repo, generates skeleton templates pre-filled from CC config data
- **Doc detection logic:** Standalone repos check root `/`, consolidated repos (with subPath) check `{subPath}/docs/` then `{subPath}/` then root
- Helper functions: `generateSessionBrief()`, `generateSkeletonContext()`, `generateSkeletonPlan()`, `generateSkeletonChangelog()`, `getDocsPath()`
- Standard doc filenames defined in `CLAUDE_PREP_DOCS` constant
- `deployments` prop added to `ProjectsTab` for session brief generation
- JSZip (already loaded via CDN) used for zip creation

### v8.12.0 — Projects as Stored Data (Priority 1)
- **Projects promoted from hardcoded constant to first-class stored objects** in `config.projects`
- `SEED_PROJECTS` replaces `DEFAULT_PROJECTS` — used only for initial migration
- `_standalone` concept removed — replaced by `other` project (catch-all, non-deletable)
- `ConfigManager` gains project CRUD: `addProject()`, `updateProject()`, `removeProject()`, `getProjectAppCount()`
- `mergeWithDefaults()` handles project migration from old format, including `cc_projectStates` → `config.projects[id].state`
- `getProjectsWithApps()` now accepts `projects` parameter (reads from config instead of constant)
- `ProjectEditModal` — new component for create/edit/delete projects with name, icon, color picker (7 themes), description, sort order
- `ProjectsTab` header gains "New Project" button; each project card gains ✏️ edit button
- `AppEditModal` and `SetupNewAppView` dropdowns now read from `config.projects`
- `DashboardView` now receives `config` prop for project-aware filtering
- Project active/hidden state now persisted in `config.projects[id].state` instead of separate `cc_projectStates` localStorage

### v8.11.0 — Functions Dashboard & Log Viewer (Phase 3)
- `FirebaseView` gains two more tabs: ⚡ Functions | 📋 Logs (now 4 tabs total)
- `FirebaseFunctionsDashboard` — new component showing all Cloud Functions at a glance
  - Summary cards: active/total functions, errors in 24h, last deploy time, last refresh
  - Functions table: name, status badge, runtime, memory, 24h error count, last deploy, health ping
  - Health ping: POST to each function's HTTPS endpoint, shows response time and status
  - Ping All button to test all functions sequentially
  - Error counts fetched from Cloud Logging API (severity>=ERROR, last 24h)
- `FirebaseLogViewer` — new component for searching and filtering Cloud Logging entries
  - Filter by severity (All/Debug/Info/Warning/Error/Critical)
  - Filter by function name (populated from returned logs)
  - Text search within log payloads
  - Configurable page size (25/50/100/200)
  - Auto-refresh toggle (30-second interval)
  - Severity summary bar with clickable counts
  - Color-coded log entries with timestamp, severity badge, function name, and payload
  - Supports both textPayload and jsonPayload log formats
  - Click function name in any log entry to filter to that function

### v8.10.0 — Firebase Security Rules Manager (Phase 2)
- `FirebaseView` refactored to tabbed layout: Data Browser | Rules
- `FirebaseRulesManager` — rules viewer/editor/deployer with history and rollback

### v8.9.0 — Firebase Admin Token Management
- `FirebaseAdmin` class: service account storage, JWT signing (Web Crypto RS256), OAuth2 token exchange
- Admin API methods: `getRules()`, `putRules()`, `listFunctions()`, `getLogs()`
- `FirebaseAdminSettings` component in Settings view
- 3-point connection test (token, rules, functions)
- Token caching with 55-minute auto-refresh

## Pending / Future Work

### Priority 1: Projects as Stored Data + Create/Edit Modal — ✅ COMPLETED (v8.12.0)

**Goal:** Promote projects from a hardcoded constant to a first-class data entity in `cc_config_v3`.

**Current state:** Projects are hardcoded in `DEFAULT_PROJECTS` (~line 352). There's no UI to create, edit, or delete projects. The `ProjectsTab` reads from this constant and merges it with app data to build project cards.

**What exists that's useful:**
- Project schema is well-defined: `{ id, name, icon, color, description, order }`
- 7 color themes already in `PROJECT_COLORS` (indigo, rose, emerald, amber, slate, cyan, purple)
- `getProjectsWithApps()` already handles unknown project IDs gracefully — falls back to `_standalone`
- Project state (active/hidden) already persists to localStorage
- The `AppEditModal` has a project dropdown, but only lists `DEFAULT_PROJECTS`

**What's missing:**
- No project storage in config/localStorage — projects only exist as a constant or as inferred from `app.project` fields
- No create/edit/delete project modal
- No way to persist custom project definitions (name, icon, color, description, order) across sessions
- The project dropdown in `SetupNewAppView` and `AppEditModal` only references `DEFAULT_PROJECTS`

**What needs to happen:**
1. Add `config.projects` object to `cc_config_v3` via ConfigManager — store custom projects alongside defaults
2. Migrate existing `DEFAULT_PROJECTS` into stored config on first load
3. Build a Project Edit Modal (create/edit/delete) with fields: name, icon, color (picker from `PROJECT_COLORS`), description, order
4. Update `getProjectsWithApps()` to read from `config.projects` instead of `DEFAULT_PROJECTS`
5. Update project dropdowns in `SetupNewAppView` and `AppEditModal` to include custom projects

### Priority 2: Consolidate App Creation into Projects View

**Goal:** Merge the Setup New App wizard into the Projects view so app creation is contextual and unified.

**Current state:** There are two different ways to add an app:
- `SetupNewAppView` — A standalone 4-step wizard at Configure → Setup New App (creates repos, enables Pages, seeds files, generates Claude prompts)
- `ProjectsTab` "Add App" button — Opens `AppEditModal` (a basic form that just adds a config entry)

**The fix:** When "Add App" is clicked from within a project in the Projects view, launch the full wizard (pre-filled with that project) instead of the basic modal. Then remove the standalone Setup New App nav entry.

**Steps:**
1. Refactor the wizard steps from `SetupNewAppView` into a reusable modal/flow
2. Wire the Projects view "Add App" button to launch the full wizard, pre-selecting the project
3. Remove the standalone Configure → Setup New App nav entry
4. Keep `AppEditModal` for editing existing apps (it's the right tool for that)

### Priority 3: Firebase-per-App Metadata

**Goal:** Track which Firebase paths each app uses, so Command Center knows the relationship between apps and Firebase data.

**What to add:** A new field on app definitions:
```javascript
firebasePaths: ['users/{uid}/quotle', 'gameshelf-public/quotle']
```

This creates a formal link between apps and their Firebase data, which enables:
- Firebase data browser knowing which app "owns" a path
- Impact analysis when changing rules (which apps are affected)
- Documentation of the data schema per app

### Phase 2: Security Rules Manager — ✅ COMPLETED (v8.10.0)

**Goal:** View, edit, and deploy Firebase RTDB security rules directly from Command Center without needing the Firebase Console.

**Backend (already done in v8.9.0):**
- `firebaseAdmin.getRules()` → returns JSON object of current RTDB rules
- `firebaseAdmin.putRules(rulesObject)` → deploys new rules (PUT, overwrites existing)
- Both require a valid service account key configured in Settings

**UI to build — new view or tab under Monitor → Firebase:**
1. **Rules Viewer** — Fetch and display current rules as formatted JSON (syntax highlighted)
2. **Rules Editor** — Editable textarea/code editor for modifying rules JSON
3. **Deploy button** — PUT updated rules with confirmation dialog ("This will overwrite all existing rules. Continue?")
4. **Validation** — Parse JSON before deploy, show errors if invalid
5. **Rules History** — Before each deploy, snapshot the current rules to localStorage (`cc_rulesHistory`) with timestamp, so user can diff/rollback
6. **Rollback** — Select a previous snapshot and deploy it

**Where it should live in nav:**
- Option A: New tab inside the existing `FirebaseView` (Monitor → Firebase → add "Rules" tab alongside current data browser)
- Option B: New standalone view (Monitor → Rules) — probably overkill for now
- Recommend Option A — keeps all Firebase stuff together

**Search patterns for relevant code:**
- `function FirebaseView` — current Firebase data browser (~line 8265+)
- `class FirebaseAdmin` — admin API class (~line 68+, search `class FirebaseAdmin`)
- `const firebaseAdmin` — global singleton instance
- `getRules()` / `putRules()` — already implemented in FirebaseAdmin class

### Phase 3: Functions Dashboard & Error Monitoring — ✅ COMPLETED (v8.11.0)

**Goal:** See all Cloud Functions at a glance — which are healthy, which have errors, recent logs — without going to the Google Cloud Console.

**Backend (already done in v8.9.0):**
- `firebaseAdmin.listFunctions(location)` → returns array of Cloud Function objects (name, status, runtime, updateTime, entryPoint, availableMemoryMb, httpsTrigger.url)
- `firebaseAdmin.getLogs({filter, orderBy, pageSize})` → returns array of log entries (timestamp, severity, textPayload/jsonPayload, resource.labels.function_name)
- See ARCHITECTURE.md for full response shapes

**Known functions in word-boxing project:**
- `getHint` — AI hints via Claude API (auth required)
- `getHintUsage` — Check hint rate limits (auth required)
- `createCoinCheckout` — Stripe checkout session (auth required)
- `stripeWebhook` — Payment webhook (no auth, server-to-server)
- `getTransactionHistory` — Wallet transaction history (auth required)
- `resetPurchaseHistory` — Dev tool (auth required)

**UI to build — enhance IntegrationsView or new tab in FirebaseView:**
1. **Functions List** — Table: function name, status badge (ACTIVE/green, other/red), runtime, memory, last deployed time
2. **Health Ping** — Button to call each function's HTTPS endpoint with a test payload, show response time / error
3. **Error Log Panel** — Fetch logs with `filter: 'severity>=ERROR'`, show last 24h errors grouped by function
4. **Log Viewer** — Searchable/filterable log viewer with severity color coding (DEBUG=grey, INFO=blue, WARNING=amber, ERROR=red, CRITICAL=red+bold)
5. **At-a-Glance Summary** — Card at top: X functions active, Y errors in last 24h, last deploy time

**Where it should live:**
- Recommend enhancing the existing `IntegrationsView` (Monitor → Integrations) which already has Firebase/Claude/Stripe status checks but they're basic. OR add "Functions" and "Logs" tabs to `FirebaseView`.

**Search patterns for relevant code:**
- `function IntegrationsView` — current integrations status view
- `FUNCTIONS_BASE` — current functions endpoint constant (`https://us-central1-word-boxing.cloudfunctions.net`)
- `integrations` object — current integration definitions with function lists
- `class FirebaseAdmin` → `listFunctions()`, `getLogs()`

### Phase 4: Firebase Project Alias / Multi-project

**Goal:** Decouple the UI from the legacy "word-boxing" project name. Prepare Command Center's data model so that when new Firebase projects are created, CC can manage them without code changes.

**What to build:**
1. **Project-level Firebase config** — Add optional `firebaseConfig` field to project schema: `{ projectId, databaseURL, functionsRegion, alias }`. If not set, falls back to the global `FIREBASE_CONFIG`.
2. **Display alias** — Anywhere CC shows "word-boxing", show the alias ("Game Shelf") instead. The underlying project ID stays the same.
3. **Multi-project FirebaseAdmin** — Currently `firebaseAdmin` is a singleton tied to one SA key. Support multiple SA keys keyed by project ID, so each CC project can have its own Firebase admin access.
4. **Project selector in FirebaseView** — Dropdown to switch between Firebase projects when browsing data/rules/functions.

**This is future work.** Not needed until you actually create a second Firebase project. The main value now is making sure Phase 2-3 code doesn't hardcode `word-boxing` anywhere — use `FIREBASE_CONFIG.projectId` and `firebaseAdmin.serviceAccount.project_id` instead.
