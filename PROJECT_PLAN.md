## Planned Features

### Near Term — Push Docs Improvements
- [ ] **Preserve folder structure** from zip uploads (e.g. `reference/DATA_MODEL.md` → pushed to `reference/` in repo)
- [ ] **Consolidated repo doc push** — respect `{subPath}/docs/` convention when pushing to shared repos
- [ ] **Batch commit** — push all docs in a single commit instead of one per file

### Near Term — Priority 2: Consolidate App Creation into Projects View
- [ ] **Refactor wizard** — Extract `SetupNewAppView` steps into a reusable modal/flow component
- [ ] **Wire "Add App" in ProjectsTab** — Launch full wizard pre-filled with the parent project
- [ ] **Remove standalone nav entry** — Remove Configure → Setup New App from navigation
- [ ] **Keep `AppEditModal`** — Retain for editing existing apps (different use case from creation)

### Near Term — Priority 3: Firebase-per-App Metadata
- [ ] **`firebasePaths` field** — New array field on app definitions: `['users/{uid}/quotle', 'gameshelf-public/quotle']`
- [ ] **Path editor in AppEditModal** — UI to add/remove Firebase paths per app
- [ ] **Path display in ProjectsTab** — Show Firebase paths in app detail view
- [ ] **Cross-reference in FirebaseView** — When browsing a path, show which app owns it

### ~~Near Term — Firebase Admin Phase 2: Security Rules Manager~~ ✅ COMPLETED (v8.10.0)
- [ ] **Rules tab in FirebaseView** — Add "Rules" tab alongside existing data browser in Monitor → Firebase
- [ ] **Fetch & display rules** — Call `firebaseAdmin.getRules()`, render as formatted/highlighted JSON
- [ ] **Edit rules** — Editable textarea or code editor for modifying rules JSON
- [ ] **Validate before deploy** — Parse JSON, show syntax errors before allowing deploy
- [ ] **Deploy rules** — Call `firebaseAdmin.putRules()` with confirmation dialog
- [ ] **Rules history** — Snapshot current rules to localStorage (`cc_rulesHistory`) before each deploy
- [ ] **Rollback** — Select previous snapshot and re-deploy it

### ~~Near Term — Firebase Admin Phase 3: Functions & Error Monitoring~~ ✅ COMPLETED (v8.11.0)
- [x] **Functions table** — Call `firebaseAdmin.listFunctions()`, show name, status badge, runtime, memory, last deploy
- [x] **Function health ping** — Call each function's HTTPS endpoint, show response time or error

### Medium Term — Firebase Admin Phase 4: Project Alias / Multi-project
- [ ] **firebaseConfig field on project schema** — Optional `{ projectId, databaseURL, functionsRegion, alias }`

### Medium Term — Other
- [ ] **Doc migration: LabelKeeper** — Restructure to standard: README.md→CONTEXT.md, PROJECT-PLAN.md→PROJECT_PLAN.md, FIXES.md→CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] **Doc migration: Quotle.info** — Split PROJECT_FOUNDATION.md into CONTEXT.md + PROJECT_PLAN.md, add CHANGELOG.md + RELEASE_NOTES.txt
- [ ] **Doc commit from Claude Prep** — Option to commit generated skeleton docs back to the repo via GitHub API
- [ ] **Config export/import** — Share config between machines/browsers
- [ ] **Deployment diff** — Show what changed between versions before deploy
- [ ] **Automated version bump** — Auto-increment version in HTML before deploy

### Long Term
- [ ] **Command Center self-update** — Detect new version, deploy itself
- [ ] **Multi-user support** — Multiple operators with different permissions
- [ ] **Webhook integration** — Trigger deploys from external events
- [ ] **Performance dashboard** — Page load times, Core Web Vitals from deployed apps

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Single HTML File?
Command Center deploys the same way as the apps it manages — a single index.html pushed to a GitHub Pages repo. This dogfoods the deployment pipeline and keeps things simple.

### Why React via CDN?
No build step means the file works from file:// for local development and from GitHub Pages for production. CDN React is cached after first load.

### Why LocalStorage for Config?
Config is per-machine by design. Different operators might have different GitHub tokens and preferences. The ConfigManager handles migration across versions.

### Why Projects Instead of Categories?
Categories (public/internal/other) were flat and didn't scale. Projects provide hierarchical organization that maps to real work.

### Why Service Account for Firebase Admin? (v8.9.0)
Firebase admin APIs (rules, functions, logging) require Google OAuth2 with service account scope — Firebase user auth alone can't access these management endpoints. The JWT→OAuth2 flow runs entirely in-browser using Web Crypto API, with no server-side dependency. The service account key is stored in localStorage alongside other credentials (GitHub PAT). This is acceptable for an internal tool with a small security surface.
